Revision of related laws and establishment of linkage and cooperation system to expand disability categories and establish a diagnostic system\n• Engage in discussions to provide realistic and practical support and to reorganize laws and regulations related to learning disabilities and slow learners.  • Connect related laws and regulations regarding educational support for eligible students such as the Lifelong Education Promotion Act, Act on Guaranteeing and Supporting Rights of Persons with Developmental Disabilities, local government ordinances, Ordinances on Career Education Promotion, and Ordinances on Promotion of Employment of People With Disabilities and Vocational Rehabilitation Support.  • Promote public understanding and agreement on the definition of and implementation plan for basic academic achievement.\n\n\n\n4.1.2. Establishment of a cooperation system to expand disability categories and establish a diagnostic system\n• Establish a cooperation system to support the development of students in and out of school through advice and consultations with learning help centers, special education support centers, above centers, special education classes, and above classes in each city and region.  • Establish a specific philosophy and vision for cooperation. Only when there is a purpose and direction can a practical plan be derived.  • Develop cooperation plans from the policy and program planning stage. • Establish standards for the specific division of roles and teaching methods for each teacher.  • Establish inter-departmental systems, such as education and welfare departments, special education systems, and career and vocational education systems. Break away from the current short-term, one-time program approach.  • Assign personnel majoring in learning disabilities (e.g., special education teachers or professionals) to departments related to basic academic achievement in each city and provincial office of education. Dispatch teachers specializing in special education or learning disabilities.  • Establish interconnectivity rather than a mutual comparison of the direction and intensity of support for students eligible for basic and special education.  • Establish reasonable measures with conflict management experts for handling cases where violence occurs due to students in special education or their parents.  • Suggest ways to connect and improve the education–welfare–medical system to support the education of infants and toddlers with disabilities.\n\n\n\n4.1.3.

Support for students with learning disabilities by identifying and linking out-of-school youth education information\n• Set clear standards for information that is necessary and educationally effective for parents raising target students and strengthen information accessibility through consensus among expert groups within the Ministry of Education.  • Connect with various organizations such as the Ministry of Education and Employment, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (cooperation with lifelong education institutions for individuals with developmental disabilities); the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (out-of-school youth education); the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism; and the Culture and Arts Education Center.  • Increase activities to protect human rights for students with learning disabilities and human rights education to students eligible for special education.  • Prioritize understanding of out-of-school learning disabilities and learning challenges, and parents’ needs.\n\n\n2.2. Diagnosis and education support by identifying key characteristics of students with learning disabilities and related disabilities\n2.2.1. Identification of characteristics of students with learning disabilities and related disabilities and support for customized education\n• Establish a flexible and appropriate professional support system through sharing of student history and context (e.g., active professional intervention by providers on issues such as refusal to select special education recipients and selection of special education recipients with different types of disabilities).  • Designate relevant ministries to customize education for students with learning disabilities and learning challenges according to their individual characteristics and providing necessary support for each life cycle.  • Public officials within the Ministry of Education should be aware of inter-departmental issues, change awareness through smooth communication and active sense of responsibility, and understand the people who support students with learning disabilities and learning challenges.  • Investigate and identify consultation and management roles in professional research institutions that provide common support for people with learning disabilities and learning challenges.\n\n\n\n2.2.2. Need for comprehensive information and systematic support based on the cognitive, psychological, and emotional characteristics of students with learning disabilities\n• Experiment with educational approaches according to the various cognitive, psychological, and emotional characteristics of students and develop a comprehensive manual of research results.  • Provide comprehensive information delivery and systematic support through inter-ministerial policy linkage for early detection of infants with or at risk for disabilities and early intervention to prevent secondary disabilities and promote development.  • Assign appropriate personnel by identifying the perspectives of various learners, related experiences, and expertise of persons in charge of inter-ministerial connection.\n\n\n\n2.2.3. Establishment of a multi-tiered system of support team and connection system for diagnosis and intervention of students with learning disabilities\n• Form a multi-tiered system of support team including special education teachers for clinical diagnosis and cooperation.  • Secure all professional personnel (e.g., therapists, social workers, and counselors) surrounding the student as members of the individualized education support team.  • Systemize close linkage with multi-tiered system of supports in the following order: (a) all-student intervention, (b) focus group intervention, and (c) diagnosis referral and intervention for students eligible for special education."

In the case of special education support centers, the spectrum of students eligible for special education supported is wide; thus, these centers should not be limited to the role of simply supporting basic academic achievement.  • Actively support learning through resident or dispatched teachers.  • Assign and dispatch teachers in charge of basic academic achievement to each school to address the lack of quality control with only the basic academic achievement support manager.  • Cooperate to discover and support customized education programs.\n\n\n\n1.2.2. Development and dissemination of daily life and parenting programs related to basic academic achievement support and connection\n• Provide support centered on daily life and life skills in addition to subjects such as reading and math.
